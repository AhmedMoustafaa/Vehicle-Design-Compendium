# Vehicle Design Compendium

Welcome to the Vehicle Design Compendium!

This repository serves as a curated collection of references, tutorials, notes, and practical resources dedicated to the comprehensive design of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional, this compendium aims to provide a structured pathway to understanding and applying the principles of UAV design.

## Purpose and Scope

This repository serves as a **curated collection** of resources for fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) design. It organizes:

* **Foundational textbooks**, covering classic, modern, and theoretical aspects of aircraft design.
* **Theoretical notes and summaries**, providing distilled insights on core concepts.
* **Research deep dives** into advanced topics, including detailed papers and specialized software implementations.
* **Guides and documentation for software tools**, such as DATCOM and XFLR5.
* **Practical applications and case studies**, showcasing the use of tools for analysis, optimization, and component matching.

This resource is structured to provide a comprehensive learning and reference environment for fixed-wing UAV design.

## How to Use This Compendium

This compendium is structured to guide you from foundational knowledge to specialized topics. We recommend the following approach:
