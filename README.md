# Vehicle Design Compendium

Welcome to the Vehicle Design Compendium!

This repository serves as a curated collection of references, tutorials, notes, and practical resources dedicated to the comprehensive design of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional, this compendium aims to provide a structured pathway to understanding and applying the principles of UAV design.

## Purpose and Scope

The goal of this project is to centralize and organize a wide range of information, moving beyond just academic theory to include practical methodologies, software tools, and real-world considerations for UAV development. It covers key disciplines such as:

* **Aerodynamics & Flight Mechanics:** Understanding how UAVs fly.
* **Propulsion Systems:** Selecting and integrating power plants.
* **Structural Design & Materials:** Building robust and lightweight airframes.
* **Avionics & Control Systems:** The brains and nervous system of the UAV.
* **Design Methodologies:** The process of taking a concept to reality.
* **Software Tools:** Utilizing industry-standard and open-source software for analysis and design.
* **Regulations & Safety:** Navigating the operational landscape.
