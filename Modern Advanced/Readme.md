Author: Andrew J. Keane & Andras Sobester
>Summary: This book -as the name suggests- is focused on UAVs primarily and thus the issue of scale difference that usually exists when reading from other sources is not present. it covers a lot of topics, starting from explaining each subsystem of the airplane, passing by the design process, and finally the manufacturing and testing.

#### Selected Chapters:
Part 3 of the book, which covers the design process is very well written and covers unfamiliar designing processes that rely on DOE, DSE, And some optimization
- Chapter 8: The Design Process
- Chapter 9: Tool Selection
- Chapter 10: Concept Design: Initial Constraint Analysis
- Chapter 11: Spreadsheet-Based Concept Design and Examples
- Chapter 12: Preliminary Geometry Design
- Chapter 13: Preliminary Aerodynamic and Stability Analysis
- Chapter 14: Preliminary Structural Analysis
- Chapter 15: Weight and Center of Gravity Control
