here I will list some of the sections I liked in each reference. Some I will expand on or summarize in another notes.

# Classic Essential References
## 1. General Aviation Aircraft Design Applied Methods and Procedures
Author: Gudmundsson
> This covers nearly every design aspect of the vehicle, it's very detailed and this should be where you first look for any question you have.

#### Selected Chapters and Sections
- Chapter 1: The Aircraft Design Process
- Chapter 3: Initial Sizing
- Chapter 6: Aircraft Weight Analysis
- Chapter 8-13: The `anatomy of` series
- Chapter 24: Longitudinal Stability and Control

# Modern, Advanced References
## 1. Small Unmanned Fixed-Wing Aircraft Design:  A Practical Approach
Author: Andrew J. Keane & Andras Sobester
>Summary: This book -as the name suggests- is focused on UAVs primarily and thus the issue of scale difference that usually exists when reading from other sources is not present. it covers a lot of topics, starting from explaining each subsystem of the airplane, passing by the design process, and finally the manufacturing and testing.

#### Selected Chapters:
Part 3 of the book, which covers the design process is very well written and covers unfamiliar designing processes that rely on DOE, DSE, And some optimization
- Chapter 8: The Design Process
- Chapter 9: Tool Selection
- Chapter 10: Concept Design: Initial Constraint Analysis
- Chapter 11: Spreadsheet-Based Concept Design and Examples
- Chapter 12: Preliminary Geometry Design
- Chapter 13: Preliminary Aerodynamic and Stability Analysis
- Chapter 14: Preliminary Structural Analysis
- Chapter 15: Weight and Center of Gravity Control
